# Calculate Wilson loop and lattice spacing

Use the WILSLP package to calculate the wilson loop. This package is related to wilslp.cc and inline_wilslp.cc.

### Take the wilson loop data to calculate lattice spacing

wloop1 is what we are familiar with.
```
1 * 1, 1 * 2, 1 * 3 ...
2 * 1, 2 * 2, ...
